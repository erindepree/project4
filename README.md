# Unreported Deaths Due to Extreme Temperature Events
Erin De Pree, Sehar Mehmood, Ken Muchira

## Problem Statement
Given that extreme temperature events are likely to increase with global climate change, we want to identify:

* The approximate minimum number of deaths due to unreported extreme temperature events in locations compared to data available independently for regions/locations

Given the following:
* Extreme heat and heat wave events are classified as when temp are above $97.5\%/2.5$ standard deviation, location specific mean, and lasting at least 2 days
* Extreme Cold/Cold Wave Events are classified as when temp are below $2.5\%/-2.5$ standard deviation, location specific mean, lasting at least 2 days

Identification of at-risk countries/underreported countries are determined by:
* publications have mentioned Africa and Middle East as being underreported.
* Comparing temperature data individually available to locations/regions reporting and not reporting (i.e. identification comes from lack of presence in the international emergency database, EM-DAT)

The timeline explored will look at years 2020-2024 from EM-DAT extreme temp and the dataset of daily surface temperatures (from the ERA5 analysis) covers 2020-2024 (more data is available but is time consuming to download).
