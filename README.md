# Unreported Deaths Due to Extreme Temperature Events

Given that extreme temperature events are likely to increase with increasing global temperatures, we want to identify:

1. extreme temperature events that resulted in minimal deaths and injuries and
2. at risk countries or under-reporting countries
to model:
3. The approximate minimum number of deaths due to unreported extreme temperature events in locations compared to data available independently for regions/locations
And to suggest as a stretch goal (time dependent):
4. Policy change

Given the following:
* Extreme Heat/Heat Wave Events are classified as when temp are above 97.5%/2.5 standard deviation, location specific mean, and lasting at least 2-3 days
* Extreme Cold/Cold Wave Events are classified as when temp are below 2.5%/-2.5 standard deviation, location specific mean, lasting at least 2 days
* Minimal deaths and injuries are classified as when the the death percentage due to extreme temp compared to overall death percentage is below 2 standard deviation

Identification of at-risk countries/underreported countries are determined by:
* publications have mentioned Africa and Middle East as being underreported.
* Comparing temp data individually available to locations/regions reporting and not reporting (i.e. identification comes from lack of presence)

The timeline explored will look at yrs 2020-2024 from EmDat extreme temp as the 2nd dataset of avg monthly surface temp (individually comparison data) we have access to is from 2020-2024
